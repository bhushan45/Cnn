# CNN
In this part, i have created the Convolutional Neural Network that is able to detect various objects in images. implement this Deep Learning model to recognize a cat or a dog in a set of pictures. However, this model can be reused to detect anything else. 

For example, you will be able to train the same model on a set of brain images, to detect if they contain a tumor or not. But if you want to keep it fitted to cats and dogs, then you will literally be able to a take a picture of your cat or your dog, and your model will predict which pet you have. We even tested it out on Hadelinâ€™s dog!
